# Quantile-Vector-Autoregression-with-Influencers-and-Communities
**``Please switch to the master branch to view more details.``**
This is a solution algorithm for a novel high-dimensional quantile vector autoregression (QVAR) model accompanied by influencers and communities.
"prepare.py" contains functions used for preparatory work before the algorithm execution, mainly functions to generate cluster indices(get_index_matrix( )), randomize initial positions(random_basis( )), and compute inter-cluster distances(index_dist( )).
"alternating.py" contains frequently used functions during execution, mainly including the kernel function, loss function, and the two most crucial alternating iterative functions: v_new_step( ) and z_new_step( ). It's worth noting that the selection of the quantile Ï„ is specified within this file.
"main.py" is the primary code for the algorithm, which includes data reading, alternating iterative optimization of the loss function, and output of the model results.
"multicode.py" is a multithreaded version of "main.py". Users can utilize this code to accelerate computations using multithreading.
"stability.py" is designed to take stability test results as input and produce the corresponding dot plots as output.
"Realdata" folder contains the macroeconomic data used in empirical analysis.
"ecoheapmap" folder stores the visualization heatmaps of the model fitting results under different quantiles.
"stability" folder stores the results of stability analysis for different numbers of clusters.
